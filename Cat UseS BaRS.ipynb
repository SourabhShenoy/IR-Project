    "The web has a large collection of documents. Most of the time spent by a user on the web is often in search of information relevant to his topic of interest. This is where recommender systems come into play. Collaborative Filtering is one of the primary approaches used in recommender systems. However, it suffers from problems such as cold start and a sparse utility matrix. In this project, we implement a hybrid approach where we use collaborative filtering and movie genre which would solve the aforementioned problems, while also attempting to reduce the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). We compare this approach with another where we establish movie correlations based on genre compositions and wordnet similarity between genres.\n",

    "### Previous Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) **_Collaborative Filtering based on User Preferences [1]:_** User Similarity is measured based on Pearson Coefficient, which is measured using the formula given below: <img src=\"pc.jpg\",width=300,height=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, $\\textit{X}$ is a user selected for recommendation, and  $\\bar{X}$ is a mean rating of user $\\textit{X}$. Then, $σ_X$ is the standard deviation of rating of user $\\textit{X}$. $X_i$ is the rating for the ith item by user $\\textit{X}$. Let $\\textit{Y}$ be the other users. The Pearson correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) **_Genre Correlation:_** Each movie belongs to at least one genre. Correlation is found by introducing edges from every preceeding genre to the genres following it. For each edge, the counter for the genre-genre is incrememted. For example, if genre combination is G1 | G2 | G5, then G1 is selected as a criterion genre first and increase by one between a criterion genre G1 and another G2 and G5. Next, G2 is selected as a criterion genre, and increase by one between G2 and G5. After all the values are obtained, the rows and columns are normalised. [1]. User ratings are predcited based on the preferred genres of users, which is obtained explicitly, and the genre correlations of the genres that movie belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How our approach differentiates:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) **_Collaborative Filtering:_**\n",
    "To measure user similarity, we use Pearson corrleation as above. We also determine the effect of demographics (age and gender) on user similarity and thereby movie rating predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "B) **_Genre Correlation:_**\n",
    "Previous approaches have user preferred genres explicitly defined, much similar to netflix or movielens which asks new users to provide their preferred genres. Since we do not have that data available, we determine user preferred genres based on the pearson similarity calculated above. The three genres that were found to be prevalent among the neighbors of the user were assigned as that user's preferred genres. "

    "### Test Data\n",
    "We used the movielens dataset i.e. ml-100k. Based on the ratings provided by the users during training, we predicted the ratings for other user movie pairs in testing data set. After all the ratings were predicted, RMSE was calculated for various demographic combinations and the results were plotted.\n",

    "### Results and Evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\image.png\",width=500,height=600>\n",
    "From the above graph we can see that as we start to bias our model with age and sex, our RMSE starts dropping. With age and sex bias, our RMSE comes out to be around 1.37 as compared to 1.40 without any bias. This can be due to the fact that users of similar ages and same sex tend to watch the similar movies and give almost the same ratings. However, the drop in the RMSE is not significant enough to generalize the demographic biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\image1.png\",width=500,height=600>\n",
    "In the above case, we are modelling our recommender system with genre-genre correlation. The RMSE drop by using age and sex biases as before. However, the RMSE values from genre-genre correlation is higher than that of the bias form mean average because in this case, because we are implicitly finding out the user's preferred genre which might not be the best representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images\\image2.png\",width=500,height=600>\n",
    "The weights used in case of no bias were 0.85 for bias form mean average and 0.15 for genre correlation predictions. These weights reduced the RMSE for the test data where no demographic biases were used for determining similarity . However, this division or choice of weights might not be appropriate when demographic bias i.e. age and sex biases were introduced to determine user user similarity. To reduce RMSE for the demographic bias cases, we should choose different weights appropriate for the scenario."

    "## Conclusion and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1). Design a hybrid recommender system, that builds user profile based on the genres of the movies watched by him and determines the rating of a movie by user based on movie genre and user user similarity.\n",
    "<br/>2). Features of the items and users that can be used to determine ratings and user-user similarity. For movie, we used its genre, while for user we build simialrity based on the movie genres it has watched, the sex of the user and his/her age.\n",
    "<br/>3). Demographic similarity between users cannot be generalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learned concepts used in the project:\n",
    "1). Recommender system designs: Model based, content based and hybrid models.\n",
    "<br/>2). User-user Collaborative filtering.\n",
    "<br/>3). RMSE evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps:\n",
    "1). The major reason for a high RMSE for genre correlation based prediction was that the user's preferred genre was implicitly calculated. We took into account the genres that were most watched by the user and its other similar users. This might not provide correct estimations for preferred genres. Taking explicit input from user will definitely provide more accurate predictions.\n",
    "<br/>2). An efficient method for prediction would be to find latent factors and reduce the rating utility matrix into a lower dimension by mapping users and movies into this latent factor space. The techniques used in the project can then be used with these new features and the ratings can be linearlly blended to provide better ratings."
